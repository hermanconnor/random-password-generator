# JavaScript Random Password Generator

A simple, customizable password generator built with HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. This tool allows users to generate strong and random passwords based on their preferences for length, character types, and more.

This was a project to practice vanilla javascript skills. For real world/production use cases, **you should use a password generator that is more cryptographically secure.**

## Features

- Generate random passwords with customizable length (4-20 characters)
- Options to include or exclude:
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Symbols
- Copy generated password to clipboard with a single click

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap 5

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to use the password generator.

3. Adjust the settings (password length, character types) and click **Generate Password** to create a random password. You can also copy the generated password to the clipboard by clicking the **Copy** button.

## How It Works

- The app uses JavaScript to generate a random password based on user-selected settings.
- Users can select which character types they want to include (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols) and set a custom password length.
- The password is then displayed in a text input field, which can be copied by clicking the copy button.
